# putils

putils is a utility library for debugging and profiling distributed AI model training workloads, with specialized support for NPU (Neural Processing Unit) and CUDA environments. The library provides non-invasive instrumentation tools that enable developers to inspect tensor states, monitor memory consumption, profile execution performance, and debug multi-process distributed training workflows without modifying core training code.
